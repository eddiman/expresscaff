<p>First Android project</p>

<p>Student project with a group in autumn 2015. </p>
<p>We were supposed to develop something using agile methods, we used ScrumBan. </p>

<p>PS: Since this project was revolved very little around coding, the code is NOT optimal at all. Also, I really sucked in Java back then.</p>
